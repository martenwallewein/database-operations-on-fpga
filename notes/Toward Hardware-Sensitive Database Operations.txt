Introduction:
- Power Wall: To achieve better clock rates, more power would be needed resulting in higher heat dissipation that cannot be handled
- Memory Wall: Access times of main memory have not evolved as good as processor capabilities of CPUs, which leads to an underutilization of CPUs.
-> Vertical scaling not sufficient

Contra: 
- Unfortunately, in order to provide optimal performance, these specialized architectures usually require algorithms that are specifically tailored to the processing device.
-> handtuned Algorithms

Pipelining:
- because when including pipeline registers between each logic unit, data items can be shifted through pipelined instructions at each clock cycle [21].
- Furthermore, pipelines are programmed into the FPGA, which eliminates pipeline flushes due to branch misprediction.


Performance vs Maintainability:
- Hand-tuned algorithms for different devices lead to high performance but decrease the maintainability of the whole system
- Duplicate code parts
-> OpenCL as alternative to build code for multiple devices, not so fast as hand-tuned algorithms
