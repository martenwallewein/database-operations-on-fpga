- OLTP VS OLAP:
	-> Dont waste CPU ressources for OLAP that are necessary for OLTP

- software-programmed query control block
- FPGA connected via PCI Express
- Save up to 94% CPU ressouces

- The accelerator has been made customizable by architecting a query control block, and making the FPGA logic behave as an interpreter of the query control block.
	-> VS Dynamic reconfiguration (expensive)

- Multiple Prediction Evaluation Units
-To that end, each PE is designed to perform 1 of 6 inequality operations

Why not SIMD or GPU:
- GPUs offer a relatively fixed architecture, however, leading to limitations similar to those of SIMD architectures.

Why not reconfigure:
- Generating a new FPGA hardware image for each query and reprogramming the FPGA is not viable since synthesis and place-and-route typically take hours to finish
- Reprogramming the FPGA with a pre-generated FPGA image is plausible, though for queries that operate on relatively small amounts of data, the reconfiguration time
- Moreover, even a slight change in the query would require regeneration of the FPGA image and reconfiguration of the FPGA.
