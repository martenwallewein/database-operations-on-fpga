Why not so wide spreaded:
- One reason may be that the processing model of FPGAs|and hence the way they are controlled by software| is very different to the traditional von Neumann architecture that computer scientists are used to deal with
- but it is unclear how FPGAs could be integrated into a DBMS

Core components of FPGA:
- Lookup Tables: configurable type of logic gates, The heart of every FPGA chip is a number of lookup tables (LUTs), a pro grammable logic unit with k inputs and a single output (where k is typically be tween four and six, see right).
- registers: Small storage types on chip
- block RAM: On Chip RAM storage
- DRAM: Off Chip RAM
- Hard cores: implementations of often-required functionality directly in silicon.
- Interconnect: wiring between all available ressources

Limitations:
- For instance, the high degree of parallelism is con trasted with relatively small amounts of memory to hold state.
- releasing this parallelism is nontrivial
- Building essentially a tailor-made piece of hardware takes the engineer beyond what he or she is used to in the software-only world.

PipeRench:
- If necessary, PipeRench will swap in and out parts of a hardware circuit if the available hardware resources are not suffcient to solve a given task.
